DDI Lifecycle instances are published and exchanged with one of two external wrappers, DDIInstance or FragmentInstance. 

The DDIInstance provides a consistent top-level publication wrapper and in addition to some basic information about itself serves as the publication wrapper 
for four primary documenttypes: StudyUnit, Group, ResourcePackage, and LocalHoldingPackage.

The FragmentInstance is a uniform package used to transfer maintainable or versionable objects plus any associated Notes or
OtherMaterial. These would be packets sent in response to system calls (external references, query calls, etc.).
