DDI-Lifecycle is designed to document and manage data across the entire life cycle, from conceptualization to data publication and analysis and beyond. It encompasses all of DDI-Codebook (https://ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Codebook/2.5/) specification and extends it.

DDI-Lifecycle Coverage
----------------------------

A Study is composed of many elements, DDI-Lifecycle allows these to be captured and described in a consistent manner so that the data can be used independently of the producer.

- Conceptual 
  - comprises those elements that define the ideas and concepts, the data that will be generated, the universe of interest and the  
    geographical area of interest
- Study Unit 
  – is made up of information about who did what and information about its dissemination – it is designed to describe for instance a 
    sweep or wave of a ‘study’
- Data Collection 
  - describes how and why and in which way the data was collected, including methodology used, and any processing
- Logical Product 
  – describes the data, the meaning of the data, the relationships between the different data items
- Physical Product 
  – describes the structure and layout of the data, irrespective of the physical rendering of the data
- Physical Instance 
  – describes the actual data, provides a place to cite and describe the coverage, where it is located and any issues relating to 
    quality and statistical summaries
